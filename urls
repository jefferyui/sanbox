Here are some common approaches to anomaly detection

Statistical methods:
Z-Score/Standard Score: This method measures how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean. Points that fall far from the mean are considered anomalies.
Percentiles: Identifying anomalies based on percentiles or quantiles, where values below or above a certain threshold are considered outliers.
Machine learning algorithms:
Isolation Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds a tree structure to isolate anomalies efficiently.
One-Class SVM: A support vector machine (SVM) model trained to classify data points as normal or outliers.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Assigns an anomaly score based on the distance to the K-nearest neighbors, with distant points being potential anomalies.
Autoencoders: Neural networks designed to learn a compressed representation of data, where reconstruction error can be used to identify anomalies.
Clustering methods:
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Clusters data points based on their density, with points that do not belong to any cluster considered outliers.
K-Means Clustering: Data points that do not belong to well-defined clusters may be considered anomalies.
Time-series analysis:
Moving Averages: Identifying anomalies based on deviations from the moving average or exponential moving average.
Seasonal Decomposition: Decomposing a time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components, with anomalies often detected in the residual component.
Proximity-based approaches:
Mahalanobis Distance: Measures the distance of data points from the center of the data distribution, considering correlations between features.
Local Outlier Factor (LOF): Computes the local density deviation of a data point compared to its neighbors, identifying regions of different densities.
